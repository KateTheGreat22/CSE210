            Hey y'all! My name is Kaitlyn Johnson, and I am at the end of my junior year at BYUI. I am an English major and a
            computer science minor. Due to growing up in the middle of the mountains of Arizona, I love to do pretty much anything outside. 
            A couple of my interests are reading, robotics, cooking, and singing off key karaoke with my friends. I served my mission in
            the Everett, Washington mission. I would love to be a college professor one day and continue to help people to find their own voice.
